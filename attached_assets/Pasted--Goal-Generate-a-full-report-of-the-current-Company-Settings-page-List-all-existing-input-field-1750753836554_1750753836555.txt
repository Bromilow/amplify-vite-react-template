🛠 Goal: Generate a full report of the current Company Settings page:

List all existing input fields and their bound data model fields

Describe the layout structure (rows, columns, cards, tabs)

Identify where additional fields (e.g. UIF rate, SDL rate, SARS thresholds) can be added cleanly

Output the report to:
app/Reports/COMPANY_SETTINGS_VIEW.md

🔍 Target Areas:
/templates/company/settings.html or similar

Any JS/FlaskForm/WTForms logic that maps data

Route/controller that loads and submits company settings

📋 Report Structure:
