# üéØ I want to clean up and standardize the Add New Employee form and the Edit Employee modal.

# Please help me verify the following across:
# - templates/employees/new.html (Add form)
# - templates/employees/view.html (Edit modal)
# - routes in employees.py and services if applicable

1. üßπ LEGACY FIELDS:
   - Check if any of these fields are still present in the templates or being processed in the backend:
     - medical_aid_employee
     - medical_aid_employer
     - union_fees
     - sdl_contributing (as a numeric value, not just a flag)
     - uif_contributing (same)
   - Highlight where they're used and confirm whether they‚Äôre safe to remove.

2. ‚úÖ NEW DEFAULTS & RECURRING DEDUCTIONS:
   - In `POST /employees/` (Add route):
     - Confirm that CompanyDeductionDefaults are applied when a new employee is created.
     - Confirm that any employee-level recurring deductions are created accordingly.
   - In `POST /employees/<id>/edit`:
     - Confirm how recurring deductions are updated (or whether they're separate via AJAX)

3. üîÅ AUTO-CALCULATED FIELDS:
   - Identify whether UIF and SDL amounts are:
     - Shown on-screen during salary input
     - Stored in employee model (legacy) or only calculated at payroll entry time
   - Confirm where calculation logic lives (JS, Python service)

4. üß™ JAVASCRIPT FUNCTIONALITY:
   - Search for JS functions that handle:
     - Real-time salary-based calculation (UIF, SDL, etc.)
     - Toggle logic for medical aid, union, deductions
     - SA ID validation and auto-filling DOB/gender
   - Confirm if any functions exist only in the Add form but not reused in Edit modal

5. üß± MODEL DEPENDENCIES:
   - Confirm that `EmployeeRecurringDeduction` is the **only active source** for recurring deductions
   - Confirm if any backend logic still reads deduction values from the `Employee` model itself

# ‚úÖ I want to:
# - Remove legacy/duplicate deduction fields
# - Centralize deduction handling via recurring system
# - Auto-calculate UIF/SDL from salary in the form
# - Keep both forms clean, functional, and consistent
