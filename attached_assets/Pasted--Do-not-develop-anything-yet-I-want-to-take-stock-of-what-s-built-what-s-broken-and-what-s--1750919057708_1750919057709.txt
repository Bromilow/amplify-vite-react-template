🛑 Do not develop anything yet.
📋 I want to take stock of what’s built, what’s broken, and what’s missing.

Please do the following:

Create a new file in the project root called FEATURES_AND_GAPS.md.

Use the following structure to populate it:

## 🛠 Known Functional Gaps

- [ ] Compliance reminders don’t always render in calendar
- [ ] Stats cards show zero even when deadlines exist
- [ ] Payslip logic doesn’t account for irregular work patterns
- [ ] Cannot import batch casuals via CSV
- [ ] Leave tracking not implemented
- [ ] No support for managing issued PPE/clothing per season

## 🔜 Next Actions

- [ ] Fix compliance calendar rendering issue
- [ ] Add `/admin/compliance-rules` for power users
- [ ] Build UI19 generation logic (template + PDF exporter)
- [ ] Scope CSV import for casuals
Once the file is created, cross-check all entries against what is currently implemented in the app.

✅ Confirm what is fully functional

⚠️ Flag what is partially implemented or buggy

❌ Clearly mark what is not started

Do not build or modify any features yet.
This is purely for status and gap analysis.
