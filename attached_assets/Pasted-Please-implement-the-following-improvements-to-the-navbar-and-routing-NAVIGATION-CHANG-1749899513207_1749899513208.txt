Please implement the following improvements to the navbar and routing:

---

üß≠ NAVIGATION CHANGES:

1. **Top Navbar Enhancements**:
   - Add a company selector dropdown labeled **"Select Company"** on the top-right of the navbar.
   - This dropdown should:
     - Only appear for users with access to multiple companies.
     - Show "Select Company" as the default if no company is selected.
     - List all companies the user has access to.
     - On selection, set the selected company in session and redirect to the company dashboard.

2. **Show Company Navigation Bar (Second Navbar) Conditionally**:
   - Only display the **second navbar** (containing links like Employees, Payroll, Reports, etc.) **if a company is selected in the session**.
   - This bar should not appear on the Portfolio Dashboard or Login page.

üíº SESSION & ROUTING BEHAVIOR:

3. On login:
   - If the user has only one company, automatically select it and redirect to `/dashboard/`.
   - If user has multiple companies, redirect to the **Portfolio Dashboard** (`/accountant/dashboard`) with no company pre-selected.
   - If user selects a company from the dropdown later, store it in session and show the company dashboard and second nav.

4. When switching companies via the dropdown:
   - Update the session's selected company ID and name.
   - Redirect to the company dashboard automatically.

üß© TECH DETAILS:

- Store selected company ID in session (e.g., `session['selected_company_id']`)
- Make sure the `base.html` template:
  - Always shows the top navbar
  - Conditionally renders the second navbar only if `selected_company_id` is set in session
- Add utility method (if not already present) to fetch current company from session in routes/templates
- Ensure visual design of the dropdown is consistent with Bootstrap style and doesn't clutter the top-right

---

üîÅ Optional Enhancements:
- If a user deselects the company (e.g., selects "Select Company" again), clear the session value and redirect back to Portfolio Dashboard.
- Show toast message or alert: "Company context cleared."

---

Test case:
- Login as `admin@payroll.co.za` / `admin123`
- Verify Portfolio Dashboard loads with no company selected
- Use dropdown to switch between companies and confirm second nav appears
