Please follow the global rules in `PROJECT_RULES.md`

---

### 🧩 Context

The current employee form accepts arbitrary cell phone numbers without validation or formatting. This causes data inconsistencies and fails compliance requirements.

---

### ✅ Required Update: South African Cell Number Validation and Formatting

---

### 1️⃣ Cell Number Validation

- **Valid prefixes**: Must start with `06`, `07`, or `08` (South African mobile numbers)
- **Length**: Must be exactly 10 digits
- **Pattern**: `^0[6-8][0-9]{8}$`

---

### 2️⃣ Format Conversion (on Save)

- When the user submits a number like `0791234567`, store it as `+27791234567`
- Conversion rule:
  - Replace the leading `0` with `+27`
  - Result: `+27xxxxxxxxx`

---

### 3️⃣ Error Handling

- If the number is:
  - Less than 10 digits
  - Has an invalid prefix (e.g., 05x or 01x)
  - Includes non-numeric characters
- Then:
  - Show an inline validation error:  
    ❌ “Please enter a valid South African mobile number starting with 06, 07, or 08.”

---

### 4️⃣ UI Enhancements

- In both `add_employee.html` and `edit_employee_modal.html`, below the cell number input:
  - Add a label or note:
    ```html
    <small class="form-text text-muted">
      Example: 0791234567 will be saved as +27791234567
    </small>
    ```

---

### 5️⃣ Affected Files and Areas

- `templates/employees/new.html` → Add Employee form
- `templates/employees/edit_employee_modal.html` → Edit Employee modal
- `routes/employees.py` → Normalize and validate phone number before saving
- Optional: Add helper function like `normalize_cell_number()` in `utils/formatters.py`

---

### 🧪 Output

- ✅ User enters: `0812345678` → stored as `+27812345678`
- ✅ Invalid input like `0512345678` shows validation error
- ✅ Add + Edit forms both support this logic
- ✅ Error messages and examples shown inline

---

### 📎 Knock-On Check

- Update any export views or API responses to ensure cell numbers are consistently formatted
- Review company-wide employee imports to see if they require the same transformation
