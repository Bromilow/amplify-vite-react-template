### 🛠️ Task: Fix Department Initialization, Filtering, and UI Layout

---

### 1. 🚨 Functional Fixes

#### a. Default Department Initialization
- On creation of a new company:
  - Automatically initialize it with a predefined set of default departments:  
    `["Engineering", "Research", "QA", "Human Resources", "Consulting", "Sales", "Staff", "Finance", "Development"]`
  - These should be stored in the `departments` table with `is_default=True` and linked to that company’s ID.

#### b. Company-Specific Filtering
- Update the **Add Employee** and **Edit Employee** forms so that:
  - The Department dropdown only shows departments that belong to the **current company**.
  - Exclude departments belonging to other companies.
  - This applies to both frontend population logic and backend query logic.

### 2. 🎨 UI Fixes

#### Department Management Card (`departments_management_card.html`)
- Redesign the card layout:
  - Move "Total Departments", "Default Departments", "Custom Departments" labels to a single row across the **top** of the card
  - Below that, display the departments in a **table-style layout** or list group
  - Use consistent Bootstrap spacing and responsive layout (`col-md-4`, `mb-3`, etc.)

### 🧠 Knock-on Effects to Check

- Ensure that creating a company via the admin or registration flow now also adds departments
- Verify that employees created with custom departments still function properly
- Check department-related dropdowns in:
  - Add Employee form
  - Edit Employee modal
  - Employee table column (if department is shown)
