Add a full user registration flow by implementing a new `/auth/register` route.

1. **New Route: `/auth/register`**
   - Methods: GET (render form), POST (handle submission)
   - Template: `templates/auth/register.html`

2. **Registration Form Fields**:
   - First Name
   - Last Name
   - Email (must be unique)
   - Password + Confirm Password
   - User Type: Dropdown with two options:
     - “I am an accountant managing multiple businesses”
     - “I am a business owner managing my own company”
   - If “business owner” is selected, show company creation fields:
     - Company Name
     - Industry
     - Registration Number
     - Email, Phone, Address
     - Tax Year End (date picker)

3. **POST Logic**:
   - Validate inputs
   - Hash password and create new `User`
     - If “business owner”: create `Company`, link to user, set `is_accountant=False`
     - If “accountant”: skip company creation, set `is_accountant=True`
   - Set login session and redirect:
     - If business owner → `/dashboard`
     - If accountant → `/companies/new` to start adding companies

4. **User Model Update**:
   - Confirm `is_accountant` and `is_admin` flags exist
   - Add optional `is_owner` or similar flag for company managers if needed

5. **Company Creation Logic (reuseable)**:
   - Refactor `/companies/new` route to accept POST requests
   - Create new `Company` and associate with `User` via association table

6. **Navbar and Session Improvements**:
   - Add “Register” button to navbar (only if not logged in)
   - After login, if no company is associated, redirect to `/companies/new`

7. **Template: `register.html`**:
   - Build Bootstrap-based form with show/hide JS logic for company fields
   - Include client-side validation

8. **Optional Enhancements**:
   - Auto-assign current_company_id to the created company
   - Flash success message on successful registration
   - Block duplicate email registrations

Test cases:
- Register as a business owner → redirected to dashboard with company
- Register as an accountant → prompted to add companies manually

Ensure all templates follow the dark/light mode toggle and responsive styling.
