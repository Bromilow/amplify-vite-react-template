Goal: Refactor the existing accountant_dashboard.html and associated route logic to replace the scroll-heavy portfolio dashboard with a compact, single-frame desktop view that emphasizes usability and compliance insights.

🔁 Replace Company Cards with a Responsive Portfolio Table
In accountant_dashboard.html:

Remove all .company-card elements.

Add a responsive <table> with the following columns:

Company Name (with logo/icon and optional link to details)

Sector (with emoji or tag)

Payroll Status (badges: Finalized ✅, Pending ⏳, Overdue ❌)

Last Payroll Run

Employee Count

Compliance Status (e.g. “2 overdue”, “Compliant” with hover tooltips)

Actions (buttons: [Details], [Reminders])

Ensure the table supports:

Responsive collapse on mobile (fallback to accordion/card layout)

Sorting by column

Hover tooltips (Bootstrap preferred)

📆 Add a Mini month View Calendar (Top Right Corner)
Use a lightweight JavaScript library (e.g., FullCalendar's dayGridMonth with header and toolbar hidden) or hand-rolled mini grid.

Display current month, with navigation arrows

On hover: show tooltips of reminders for that day.

On click: filter portfolio table to companies with reminders due that day.

Style to fit inside a 300px-wide sidebar or corner panel.
Use existing /accountant/calendar-data endpoint with start/end parameters to power this.

🧱 Sidebar Panel for Contextual Widgets
Create a collapsible sidebar (right-hand side) with:

🔔 Unread Notifications (summary with badge count)

🕒 Upcoming Payroll Deadlines (7-day preview)

📌 Key SARS Reminders (EMP201, IRP5, UI19, etc.)

Make sidebar sticky on desktop, collapsible on mobile.

🧹 Remove the Following:
Remove:

“Quick Stats”

“Employees by Company” chart

Old “Company Overview” cards

Consolidate redundant employee/payroll data into table columns

🧠 Additional Notes:
Create a new PortfolioService.get_portfolio_table_data(user_id) method if needed to consolidate query logic for the new table.

Reuse sars_config and reminder context objects where applicable.

The calendar filtering logic should gracefully handle no matches and invalid input.

Test layout on 1440px screen size to confirm all major elements fit above the fold.
