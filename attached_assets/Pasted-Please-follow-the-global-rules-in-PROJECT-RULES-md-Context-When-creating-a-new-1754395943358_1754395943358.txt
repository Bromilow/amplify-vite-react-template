### 🧩 Context

When creating a new employee, recurring deduction defaults (e.g. Medical Aid, Provident Fund) are preloaded into the form from company defaults.

Users are allowed to:
- Remove 1 or more of these default deductions before clicking **Save**

🚨 **Bug**: Even if the user deletes these from the form before saving, the employee is still created with all default deductions re-attached — including those the user explicitly removed.

---

### 🧠 Hypothesis

The backend logic that applies default recurring deductions is being triggered during employee creation — regardless of whether the user removed them in the UI.

---

### 🔍 Diagnostic Task

1. **Review Recurring Deduction Injection**
   - File: `routes/employees.py` (new employee route)
   - Look for logic like:
     ```python
     if company.default_recurring_deductions:
         for d in company.default_recurring_deductions:
             employee.recurring_deductions.append(...)
     ```

2. **Check What’s Posted From the Form**
   - Confirm whether the deleted deductions are removed from the form payload
   - If deleted in the frontend, the backend must **not re-add** them

3. **Fix the Flow**
   - Only apply recurring deduction defaults if:
     - The form is blank (first load)
     - Or the user explicitly re-added them

   - Recommended flow:
     - Populate default recurring deductions **client-side** only
     - On submit, rely entirely on the user's final list

4. **Adjust Backend Logic**
   - In the `/employees/new` POST route:
     - Remove any logic that re-fetches and re-adds company defaults
     - Only persist the form-submitted `recurring_deductions`

### ✅ Fix Summary

- Do not apply recurring deductions by default at the backend
- Respect user deletion actions made in the form
- Treat form-submitted deductions as the **single source of truth**
- Ensure edit modal follows the same rule (in next step)

---

### 🧪 Output

- Create a new employee
- Remove one or more default recurring deductions before saving
- ✅ Employee is saved with **only** the deductions shown at the time of submission
