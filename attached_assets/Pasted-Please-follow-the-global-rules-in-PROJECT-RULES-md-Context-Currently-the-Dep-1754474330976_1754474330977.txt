Please follow the global rules in `PROJECT_RULES.md`

---

### 🧩 Context

Currently, the "Department" dropdown in the Add/Edit Employee forms is populated by a hardcoded global list, and any custom departments added via the "Other" option become globally available — even across companies. This breaks multi-tenancy rules.

---

### 🛠️ Objective

Convert the Department system into a **company-scoped feature** with proper CRUD functionality, ensuring that:

- Each company has its own list of departments
- Add/Edit Employee forms only show that company's departments
- Admins can manage their company’s departments in the **Company Settings** panel

### 📌 Task Instructions

#### 1. 🔧 Database Changes
- Create a new table: `CompanyDepartment`
  ```python
  class CompanyDepartment(db.Model):
      id = db.Column(db.Integer, primary_key=True)
      company_id = db.Column(db.Integer, db.ForeignKey('companies.id'), nullable=False)
      name = db.Column(db.String(100), nullable=False)
      is_default = db.Column(db.Boolean, default=False)
      created_at = db.Column(db.DateTime, default=datetime.utcnow)
On new company creation, seed the following defaults (per-company):

Engineering, Research, QA, Human Resources, Consulting, Sales, Staff, Finance, Development, Other

2. 🖥️ UI – Company Settings > New Card: "Company Departments"
Add a new card titled Company Departments

Allow user to:

View all current departments

Add a new department

Edit a department name

Delete a department (with warning if it's in use by employees)

3. 👤 Employee Add/Edit Forms
Replace hardcoded dropdown with one that loads departments from CompanyDepartment scoped to the current company

Preserve "Other" option, but any new entry should:

Be added to that company’s department list

Not affect other companies

4. 🧠 Knock-on Effects
Ensure Edit Employee modal and Employee Defaults (if applicable) also pull from CompanyDepartment

Validate uniqueness of department names per company

Audit existing employees: migrate their department values to entries in CompanyDepartment where applicable

Handle deletion of departments that are currently in use (e.g. prevent or prompt re-assignment)

✅ Output
A new company_departments table with proper seeding logic

New UI panel in Company Settings: “Company Departments” with full CRUD

Add/Edit Employee forms display company-specific departments only

Any "Other" values added via the form become part of that company’s department list

No department value leaks across companies
