Please perform the following updates to ensure the Add Employee Form, Edit Employee Modal, and Employee View window are consistent and complete:

1. **Fix Duplicate Fields**:
   - Remove the second instance of “Physical Address” under “Leave & Banking” in the Add Employee form.
   - Ensure address is saved and displayed consistently.

2. **Standardize and Complete Field Sets**:

   ✅ Add the following to the **Edit Employee Modal** (matching the Add form):
   - Gender (read-only, populated from ID)
   - Date of Birth (read-only, populated from ID)
   - Marital Status (dropdown)
   - Job Title
   - Reporting Manager
   - Union Member (checkbox) and Union Name (input shown conditionally)
   - Employment Status and End Date
   - Annual Leave Days

   ✅ Also ensure **Medical Aid Information** in the Edit Modal includes:
   - Medical Aid Member (checkbox)
   - Medical Aid Scheme
   - Medical Aid Number
   - Member Type
   - Employee Contribution
   - Employer Contribution
   - Number of Dependants
   - Taxable Fringe Benefit

3. **Fix View Window Data Display**:
   - Only show one “Address Information” card with correct data
   - Ensure all medical aid fields (as above) are visible if data exists
   - Include Union Name under “Employment Information” if union member

4. **Field Behavior**:
   - “Gender” and “Date of Birth” must be **read-only** once auto-filled from the ID.
   - Show/hide logic:
     - `Union Name` only shows if `Union Member` is checked
     - Medical Aid fields only show if `Medical Aid Member` is checked

5. **Consistency Check**:
   - Match Add, Edit, and View layouts exactly: if a field exists in Add, it must be editable in Edit, and visible in View if populated.

After applying, I will test by:
- Adding a new employee with all sections filled
- Editing the employee and confirming all fields are loaded
- Viewing the employee and checking that all information is presented and no "Not provided" text appears for entered data.
