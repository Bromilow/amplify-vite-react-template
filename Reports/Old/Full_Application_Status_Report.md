## 🚨 Known Gaps and TODOs

### Critical Security Issues (Priority 1)

1. **CSRF Protection Gaps**
   - ❌ Authentication forms (login/register)
   - ❌ Employee management forms
   - ❌ Payroll processing forms
   - ❌ Admin configuration forms
   - **Impact**: Application vulnerable to CSRF attacks
   - **Fix**: Add `{{ csrf_token() }}` hidden fields and CSRF headers to AJAX

2. **AJAX CSRF Headers**
   - ❌ employee_modal.js missing CSRF token in fetch requests
   - ❌ payroll_modal.js missing CSRF token in fetch requests
   - **Impact**: AJAX forms will fail once CSRF is enforced
   - **Fix**: Add X-CSRFToken headers to all AJAX submissions

### Functional Issues (Priority 2)

3. **Recurring Deduction JavaScript Bug**
   - ❌ Amount field updates broken due to scope issue
   - ❌ Missing recurring_deductions.js file
   - **Impact**: Users cannot configure deduction amounts properly
   - **Fix**: Move JavaScript logic to correct scope

4. **Document Generation Issues**
   - ❌ UI19 PDF conversion fails on Linux
   - ❌ Character mapping bug (index 8 skipped)
   - **Impact**: Users get DOCX files instead of PDFs
   - **Fix**: Alternative PDF conversion library or fix docx2pdf

### Missing Features (Priority 3)

5. **Role Management Interface**
   - ❌ No admin interface for role assignment
   - ❌ Manual database changes required
   - **Impact**: Difficult to manage user permissions
   - **Fix**: Build role management admin interface

### Code Quality Issues (Priority 4)

7. **Form Validation Inconsistency**
   - ❌ EmployeeDefaultsForm not using FlaskForm
   - ❌ Mixed validation approaches
   - **Impact**: Inconsistent error handling
   - **Fix**: Standardize all forms to use FlaskForm

8. **JavaScript File Organization**
   - ❌ Some logic embedded in templates instead of separate files
   - ❌ Missing recurring_deductions.js file
   - **Impact**: Maintainability issues
   - **Fix**: Extract all JavaScript to separate files
