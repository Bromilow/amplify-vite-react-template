# Phase 3: Piece Salary Type Calculation Logic Implementation

## Overview
Successfully implemented comprehensive payroll calculation logic for "Piece" salary type employees, including validation, UI updates, and payslip generation.

## Implementation Summary

### 1. PayrollEntry Model Updates ✅

**File:** `app/models/payroll_entry.py`

**Changes Made:**
- Updated `gross_pay` property to handle piece work calculations
- Added logic: `pieces_produced * piece_rate` for piece work employees  
- Excluded overtime/special pay calculations for piece and monthly employees
- Maintained backward compatibility for existing salary types

**Code Changes:**
```python
@property
def gross_pay(self):
    """Calculate gross pay based on salary type (monthly, hourly, daily, piece)"""
    if self.employee and self.employee.salary_type == 'piece':
        pieces = self.pieces_produced or Decimal('0')
        rate = self.piece_rate or Decimal('0')
        ordinary_pay = pieces * rate
    # ... other salary types
```

### 2. Payroll Processing Route Updates ✅

**File:** `app/routes/payroll.py`

**Changes Made:**
- Added piece work field handling in `save_entry` route
- Implemented validation for pieces_produced > 0 and piece_rate > 0
- Added proper error messages for invalid piece work data
- Updated backend validation to accept "piece" as valid salary type

**Key Validations:**
- Units produced must be greater than 0
- Piece rate must be greater than 0
- Proper JSON error responses for validation failures

### 3. Payroll Modal Template Updates ✅

**File:** `app/templates/payroll/_payroll_modal.html`

**Changes Made:**
- Added piece work section with units produced field
- Added read-only piece rate display field
- Conditional visibility based on employee salary type
- Clear user guidance with help text

**New Fields:**
- `pieces_produced`: Number input for units produced
- `piece_rate_display`: Read-only rate display from employee settings

### 4. JavaScript Calculation Updates ✅

**File:** `app/static/js/payroll_modal.js`

**Changes Made:**
- Updated `populatePayrollModal()` to handle piece work visibility
- Modified `calculatePayroll()` for piece work gross pay calculations
- Excluded overtime calculations for piece work employees
- Added piece rate data handling and field population

**Calculation Logic:**
```javascript
if (currentEmployeeData.salary_type === 'piece') {
    const piecesProduced = parseFloat(document.getElementById('pieces_produced').value) || 0;
    const pieceRate = currentEmployeeData.piece_rate || 0;
    ordinaryPay = piecesProduced * pieceRate;
}
```

### 5. Payslip Template Updates ✅

**File:** `app/templates/payslip.html`

**Changes Made:**
- Added conditional piece work display in earnings section
- Shows "Piece Work (X units @ R0.0000)" format
- Excluded overtime/special pay for piece work employees
- Maintains BCEA compliance for piece work documentation

**Display Format:**
- Units produced with 0 decimal places
- Piece rate with 4 decimal places precision
- Total piece pay with currency formatting

### 6. Backend Validation Updates ✅

**File:** `app/routes/employees.py`

**Changes Made:**
- Updated salary type validation to include "piece"
- Applied changes to both employee creation and editing routes
- Ensures consistent validation across all employee management workflows

## Validation Requirements Implemented

### ✅ Piece Work Validation
1. **Units Produced > 0**: Enforced in payroll processing
2. **Piece Rate > 0**: Validated from employee settings
3. **Proper Error Messages**: User-friendly JSON responses
4. **Form Data Preservation**: Maintains user input on validation errors

### ✅ Statutory Deductions Compatibility
1. **UIF Calculations**: Work correctly with piece-based gross pay
2. **SDL Calculations**: Applied to piece work gross pay
3. **PAYE Calculations**: Standard tax brackets apply to piece work
4. **Medical Aid Credits**: Compatible with piece work earnings

## Files Modified

1. `app/models/payroll_entry.py` - Gross pay calculation logic
2. `app/routes/payroll.py` - Piece work field handling and validation
3. `app/routes/employees.py` - Salary type validation updates  
4. `app/templates/payroll/_payroll_modal.html` - Piece work UI fields
5. `app/static/js/payroll_modal.js` - Calculation and visibility logic
6. `app/templates/payslip.html` - Piece work display in PDF payslips

## User Experience Improvements

### ✅ Intuitive Interface
- Piece work section appears only for piece work employees
- Clear field labels and help text
- Real-time calculation updates
- Proper field ordering and grouping

### ✅ Data Integrity
- Piece rate populated from employee settings
- Validation prevents invalid entries
- Error messages guide user corrections
- Maintains data consistency across workflows

### ✅ Reporting Accuracy
- Payslips correctly display piece work details
- Statutory deductions calculated on accurate gross pay
- Compliance with South African labor legislation
- Professional PDF output formatting

## Testing Recommendations

### Manual Testing Required:
1. Create employee with "Piece Work" salary type
2. Set piece rate in employee defaults or employee record
3. Process payroll entry with units produced
4. Verify gross pay calculation: units × rate
5. Confirm statutory deductions apply correctly
6. Generate payslip and verify piece work display
7. Test validation with zero/negative values

### Edge Cases Covered:
- Zero pieces produced (validation error)
- Missing piece rate (validation error) 
- Large piece quantities (precision handling)
- Decimal piece rates (4-decimal precision)

## Phase 3 Status: ✅ COMPLETE

All Phase 3 objectives have been successfully implemented:
- ✅ PayrollEntry.gross_pay property updated for piece work
- ✅ Statutory deductions work with piece-based gross pay
- ✅ Validation for pieces_produced and piece_rate
- ✅ Payroll processing route supports piece work
- ✅ Templates display piece work information correctly

**Ready for Phase 4 or production testing.**
